ChatELN (Elenchic Logic Navigator) is a unique AI-powered thinking partner that redefines the user-AI interaction. Instead of providing direct answers, ChatELN employs the Socratic (Elenchic) method to ask intelligent, guiding questions. This process empowers users to deconstruct complex problems, challenge their own assumptions, and navigate their way to deeper understanding and novel solutions.

Core Philosophy

Guided Discovery, Not Instant Answers: The primary goal is to enhance your critical thinking skills, not to replace them. The AI acts as a catalyst for your own logic, helping you build stronger reasoning pathways.

Structured Thinking Sessions: Tailor the AI's questioning style with modes like Creative, Debugging, and Strategic to fit your specific challenge. The system is designed to adapt to different types of intellectual work.

A Notebook for Your Mind: Every session is saved, creating a permanent, exportable record of your thought process. It serves as a true Electronic Lab Notebook for your ideas, strategies, and discoveries.

Technology

Built with a modern frontend stack including React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a fast, responsive, and intuitive user experience.
